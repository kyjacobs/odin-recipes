                    Enjoy a day at the beach with this family favorite. Bring it along with you into the briny
                    depths as you set out for the adventure of a lifetime on your tube. It'll surely attract sharks,
                    but it will also incapacitate them too, so be sure to bring your phone to take wild shark pics for the gram.
                    This ham, aged overnight in rum of your choosing will absorb tons of it, so you can be certain you'll
                    remain full and also buzzed.
